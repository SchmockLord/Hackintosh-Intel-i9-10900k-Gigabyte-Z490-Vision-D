# My BIOS-settings

Here are screenshot of the most relevant BIOS-settings.

I am not saying that you have to set every setting exactly like I did. Just so you know what works for me :).

This guide was written with mother board BIOS version number "F3", but others have reported that BIOS version "F5" (the latest at time of writing) works equally well. (It is presumed that BIOS version "F4" would also work equally well.)
